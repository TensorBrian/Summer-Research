The code within Binary_MERA_Ising and Ternary_MERA Ising prepare the GS of the Infinite TFIM Chain at the critical point, along with plotting the Z, X, and Y correlators using the binary and ternary mera respectively to prepare such states and perform such calculations. This code is basically good to go, though one must edit the path to demo_tools.jl to get the code to run properly.

The code outside of these files is more experimental. I am still working to developing a way of calculating the 1st excited state of the infinite mera.
